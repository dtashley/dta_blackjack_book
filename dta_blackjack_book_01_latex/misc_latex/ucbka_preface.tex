\chapter{Preface}

Decades ago, while playing Blackjack with a basic strategy card
in hand, a player next to me offered the opinion that
Blackjack basic strategy tables/cards were all published by the casinos,
and all incorrect by design so that players would lose money to the
casinos.

I didn't find it plausible that casinos would be able to control
the content of \emph{every} published basic strategy table, but there
seemed to be other plausible scenarios that could lead to incorrect
information on
basic strategy tables.  For example, what if one erroneous basic
strategy table was copied by many authors?

The same plausible scenarios that could lead to incorrect information
in basic strategy tables could lead to incorrect published information about
card counting strategies.

I develop software for a living, so I have the necessary skills to write
simulation software.  I decided to independently write simulation software to verify
published basic strategy and card counting results, and also to answer
several of my personal questions about Blackjack strategy.

The simulation program I wrote is named \emph{blackjack\_sim\_prog\_01},
and is fully described in Chapter TBD.

This book, in essence, contains my simulation results.  (The source code
and \emph{Windows}\footnote{The program can also be compiled/run on Unix/Linux and
other platforms, but I distribute only a \emph{Windows} executable.}
executable of my simulation program can be purchased separately.)

This book attempts to answer all of the following questions:

\begin{itemize}
   \item Are published basic strategy tables correct?
   \item Is published information about casino and player advantage correct?
   \item What is the best card counting system?
   \item Is published indexed play information correct?
   \item How valuable is each indexed play?
   \item What is the minimum bet spread necessary to have a neutral game?
   \item Can Blackjack card counting systems be used against side bets?
   \item Are side bets vulnerable to card counting systems specific
         to the side bet?
   \item Does optimum indexed play or betting strategy vary with position
         within the shoe?
   \item Does optimum indexed play or betting strategy vary with the
         number of other players or a player's position at the table?
   \item What camouflage plays are available?\footnote{Camouflage play is partly
         a mathematical topic.  The way a play will be
         perceived by casino employees is a human topic, but the cost of a 
         camouflage play is a mathematical topic.  An ideal camouflage play would
         convince casino employees that you are a very unskilled player,
         and cost nothing.}
\end{itemize}

This book presents almost no mathematical insight into Blackjack.  All questions are
resolved through simulation.

This book assumes that the reader already understands Blackjack well (i.e. it is
not an introduction to Blackjack).  Some mathematical maturity is also assumed.
This book may be difficult for readers who don't meet those two criteria.

The information in this book is provided without warranty.  Like any human, I can make

Please feel free to correspond with me at \texttt{dashley@gmail.com}.  I do plan
future revisions of this book, and I'm open to the idea of improvements and enhancements.

Since someone will ask: this book was produced using \LaTeX{}, an uncommon word
processing program.

I wish you success and happiness as you apply the information contained in this book.
